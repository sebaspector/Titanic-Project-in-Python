# Titanic Voyage: Predicting Passenger Survival
This project aims to analyze the famous Titanic dataset and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of passenger survival. The dataset contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, we can uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival outcomes.
